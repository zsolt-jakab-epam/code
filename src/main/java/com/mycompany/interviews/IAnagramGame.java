/**
 * Service to provide an anagram game.
 * <p/>
 * The game is constructed with a base set of letters, e.g. the string "areallylongword",
 * which may be assumed to be all in lowercase, and with no whitespace or special characters. The user then attempts
 * to create rankList out of the letters from the base set, and score one point for each letter used. The submissions
 * must be "real rankList": use the WordDictionary to check each submission.
 * <p/>
 * For example (assuming "areallylongword" as base set of letters):
 * <ul>
 * <li>"no" is an acceptable submission, with score 2</li>
 * <li>"grow" is an acceptable submission, with score 4</li>
 * <li>"bold" is not an acceptable submission (cannot be created with letters from the base set)</li>
 * <li>"glly" is not an acceptable submission (isn't a "real word")</li>
 * <li>"woolly" is an acceptable submission with score 6</li>
 * <li>"adder" is not an acceptable submission (cannot be created with letters from the base set)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * The service maintains a list of the top ten highest-scoring submissions (the word and score).
 *
 * Assume that the load() method of the provided dictionary is called externally from this class, sometime after the
 * constructor of this class is called. Again, refer to the test skeleton for an example of the calling flow.
 *
 * <b>There is no need to make a user interface for this test</b>
 * see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagrams
