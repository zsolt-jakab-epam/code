This test has two parts:
 
1. Implement the IAnagramGame interface according to the comments in the code. Do not change any of the provided classes (except AnagramGame and AnagramGameTest). If any of the instructions are unclear, make a reasonable assumption and document it with a comment.
2. Code review IWordDictionary and WordDictionary. What would you recommend the author change in those two classes? Please provide this review by adding comments inside the two files.
 
You have **two hours** to complete the test. Your implementation should be production quality. Use any tools, practices, resources, and information you would normally use to complete production-quality code.
 
Thank you for your time, and good luck!
